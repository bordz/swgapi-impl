# Swagger generated server

Spring Boot Server

## Overview  
This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project.  
By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core), you can easily generate a server stub.  
This is an example of building a swagger-enabled server in Java using the SpringBoot framework.  

The underlying library integrating swagger to SpringBoot is [springfox](https://github.com/springfox/springfox)  

Start your server as an simple java application  

You can view the api documentation in swagger-ui by pointing to  
http://localhost:8080/  

Change default port value in application.properties

## Build Procedures

  1) Using maven to build the application jar
```bash
mvn package
```

  2) Run the application locally
```bash
cd target; java -jar appname-version.jar
```

  3) Build docker image
```bash
mvn package docker:build
```

  4) Run the build docker image
```bash
# look up prefix/artifactId at pom.xml (at docker-maven-plugin configuration block)
sudo docker run -p 8080:8080 -d prefix/artifactId

# view logs
sudo docker logs prefix/artifactId

# bash into the container
sudo docker exec -it springframeworkguru/masteringthymeleaf bash
```

  5) Build and push the image to docker registry
```bash
# if not yet done, login first
sudo docker login

# TBD save docker registry credentials to some config file

# main command
mvn package docker:build docker:push
```

## Production Deploy Procedures

should provide proper documentation on how to deploy to production
